<li>In case of a tie - for example the 3rd and 4th highest bid are the same - the computer will randomly determine which of the two bids win and  earns an item and which of the two bids loses and does not earn an item.</li>

<li>You are free to bid whatever you think will bring you the most earnings. However, for
    programming purposes we have restricted all bids to be greater than or equal to zero in
    addition to the bids for the second unit to be less than or equal to the bid on the first unit
    listed.</li>




<li>Your final payoff will be determined by only two of those 25 auctions you will
    play. More specifically, two of the 25 auction rounds will be chosen at random
    and your profits (losses) earned from that auction will be added together and divided by 10. This final
    payoff from the auction game will be added (subtracted) to
    your starting balance of $5 to determine your final balance. All final balances
    will be paid to you in cash at the end of the experiment.</li>

<li> You are not permitted to talk to each other until the experiment is over.</li>

<li>This is the end of Part 1 of the experiment. Once you click the "Next" button the experiment will begin.  Please raise your hand if you have any questions at this time.</li>
