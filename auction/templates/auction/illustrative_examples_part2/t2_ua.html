    <p> Example 1 is depicted from the perspective of Bidder A who is competing against two
    competitor: Bidder B and Bidder C. Each of these three bidders with demand for three units are competing in
    an auction in which there are eight units of the same good up for sale.

    <p>First, we focus on Table 1. Note bids have been sorted from highest
        to lowest, values are shown next to the bids. The bid that determines the market price (the 9th
        highest bid) has been highlighted with a pink background. The 8 highest bids above the pink background each earn an item. Note, the clearing
        price is always set by the only losing bid. In the example depicted in Table 1, bidder A earned 2
        unit while bidder B and C both earned 3 units. Thus in the case of Table 1, Bidder A’s profits
        are calculated as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit 1: $63 - $20 = $43</li>
        <li>Unit 2: $60 - $20 = $40</li>
        <li>and nothing on unit 3</li>
        <li>Total profit = $83</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this example, Bidder A could have earned a third unit by bidding more, provided that bid
    was sufficiently high to edge out Bidder C. Table 2 illustrates the case in which Bidder A changes
    her bid on her third unit from $20 to $40; and all other bids are held constant. Focusing on Table 2,
    we see that the clearing price is now $27. Bidder A wins 3 units and bidder B wins 3 units while
    bidder C now only wins 2 and her losing bid sets the clearing price. Thus in the case of Table 2,
    Bidder A’s profits are calculated as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit 1: $63 - $27 = $36</li>
        <li>Unit 2: $60 - $27 = $33</li>
        <li>Units 3: $44 - $27 = $17</li>
        <li>Total profits = $86</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In comparing the auction outcomes in Table 1 and Table 2, we see that Bidder A was able to
        increase her profits by bidding  more on her third unit in order to win 3 units rather
        than 2. However, it is important to point out in this example that in earning 3 (rather than 2)
        unit, Bidder A caused the market clearing price to increase from $20 to $27. This directly affects
        the price that Bidder A had to pay for her two higher valued unit. In the scenario represented in
        Table 1 and Table 2, the increase in clearing price was small enough such that winning two units
        rather than one unit increased total profits. It should be noted that this will not always be the
        case.</p>
