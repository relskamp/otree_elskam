    <p><strong>Example 1.</strong> First, we focus on Table 1. Note, Bidder A earned 1
        unit while Bidder B earned 2 units. Thus in the case of Table 1, Bidder A’s profits are calculated
        as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit 1: $63 - $20 = $43</li>
        <li>and nothing on unit 2</li>
        <li>Total profits = $43</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this example, Bidder A could have earned a second unit by bidding more, provided that bid
        was sufficiently high to edge out Bidder B. Table 2 illustrates the case in which Bidder A changes
        her bid on her second unit from $20 to $40; and all other bids are held constant. Focusing on Table
        2, we see that the market price is now $28. Bidder A wins two units and Bidder B now only wins
        one and her losing bid sets the market price. Thus in the case of Table 2, Bidder A’s profits are
        calculated as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit 1: $63 - $28 = $35</li>
        <li>Units 2: $44 - $28 = $16</li>
        <li>Total profits = $51</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In comparing the auction outcomes in Table 1 and Table 2, we see that Bidder A was able to
        increase her profits by bidding more on her second unit in order to win two units rather
        than one. However, it is important to point out in this example that in earning two (rather than
        one) unit, Bidder A caused the market price to increase from $20 to $28. This directly
        affects the price that Bidder A had to pay for her higher valued unit. In the scenario represented
        in Table 1 and Table 2, the increase in market price was small enough such that winning two
        units rather than one unit increased total profits. It should be noted that this will not always be
        the case.
