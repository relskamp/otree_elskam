<li>After the bids have been submitted, collected and ranked from highest to lowest, we report back to you the outcomes for your market: bids listed from highest to lowest, how many units you won, how much profits you earned on each unit and your total profits. Finally, the highest rejected bid - is highlighted within a pink background. For your convenience, your bids always have a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span> next to them.</li>
<li>The computer calculates the profits on each of your bids on units that you are awarded. Recall, there are two possible scenarios you may find yourself in:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>You win three units. This occurs when all three of your bids are among the 8 highest bids.<br />Your profits for unit one are: &nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> - clearingprice<br />Your profits for unit two are: &nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> - market price<br />Your profits for unit two are:  v<sub>3</sub> - market price<br />Total Profits are: &nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>3 </sub>&minus; 3 &times; market price</li>
    <li>You win two units. This occurs when two of your bids are among the 3 highest bids and you lose one bid<br />Your profits for unit one are:&nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> - market price<br />Your profits for unit two are: &nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> - market price<br />Total Profits are: = v<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> &minus; 2 &times; market price</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any unit earned at a price below its value results in a positive profit; any unit earned at a price above its value results in a negative profit.</li>
