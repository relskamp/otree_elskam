<li>After the bids have been submitted, collected and ranked from highest to lowest, we report
back to you the outcomes for your market: bids listed from highest to lowest, how many
units you won, how much profits you earned on each unit and your total profits.
The highest  losing bid ( the bid that sets the clearing price) - is highlighted with a
pink background. For your convenience, your bids always have a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span> next to them.</li>

<li>The price paid by those winning an item is equal to the losing bid (the fourth highest bid) that sets the market price.   This is called a uniform price auction - everyone pays the same market price.</li>


<li>The computer calculates you profits.  This will depend on your highest bid (b1), your second highest bid (b2), your valuation on the first unit (v1) and your valuation on the second unit (v2).  There are two possible scenarios you may find yourself in:
    <ol class="pretty-ol" type="a">
        <li><p>You win two units. This occurs when both of your bids are among the 3 highest bids.</p>
            <p>Your profits for unit one are:  v<sub>1</sub> - market price</p>
            <p>Your profits for unit two are:  v<sub>2</sub> - market price</p>
            <p>Total Profits are: v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> - 2 Ã— market price</li>
        <li><p>You only win one unit. This occurs when only one of your bids is among the three
               highest bids. Note in this case, your second bid is necessarily the only losing bid:
               Therefore this bid of yours sets the market price that you pay for the unit you won.</p>
            <p>Your profits for unit one are: v<sub>1</sub> - market price</p>
            <p>Your profits for unit two are:  0</p>
            <p>Total Profits are: v<sub>1</sub> - market price</p></li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li>Any unit earned at a price below its value results in a positive profit; any unit earned at a
price above its value results in a negative profit.</li>
