    <li>After the bids have been submitted, collected and ranked from highest to lowest, we report back to you the outcomes for your market: bids listed from highest to lowest, how many units you won, how much profits you earned on each unit and your total profits.  The highest losing bid will be is highlighted with a
        pink background. For your convenience, your bids always have a * next to them.</li>
<li>The price paid by those winning an item is equal to their submitted bid. This is called a pay-your-bid price auction.</li>
<li>The computer calculates your profits.  This will depend on your highest bid (b1), your second highest bid (b2), your third highest bid (b3), and your valuations on the first, second, and third units: (v1),  (v2) and (v3), respectively.   There are two possible scenarios you may find yourself in:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>You win three units. This occurs when all three of your bids are among the 8 highest bids.<br />Your profits for unit one are: v<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub><br />Your profits for unit two are: v<sub>2</sub> - b<sub>2</sub><br />Your profits for unit three are:  v<sub>3</sub> - b<sub>3</sub><br />Total Profits are:  v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> + v<sub>3</sub> &minus; b<sub>1</sub> &minus; b<sub>2</sub> &minus; b<sub>3</sub></li>
    <li>You win two units. This occurs when two of your bids are among the 3 highest bids.  Note in this case, your second bid is necessarily the only losing bid.<br />Your profits for unit one are: v<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub><br />Your profits for unit two are:  v<sub>2</sub> - b<sub>2</sub><br />Total Profits are:  v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> &minus; b<sub>1</sub> &minus; b<sub>2</sub></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any unit earned at a price below its value results in a positive profit; any unit earned at a price above its value results in a negative profit.</li>
</ol>
