    <li>After the bids have been submitted, collected and ranked from highest to lowest, we report back to you the outcomes for your market: bids listed from highest to lowest, how many units you won, how much profit you earned on each unit and your total profits.
        The losing bid, which will always be the ninth highest bid will be highlighted with a
        pink background.   For your convenience, your bids always have a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span> next to them.</li>
    
    <li>The price paid by those winning an item is equal to the <strong>losing bid</strong> , i.e., ninth highest bid. In other words,  everyone pays the <strong>SAME</strong>  market price.</li>
        
        
        
<li>The computer calculates your profits.  This will depend on your highest bid (b1), your second highest bid (b2), your third highest bid (b3), and your valuations on the first, second, and third units: (v1),  (v2) and (v3), respectively.   There are two possible scenarios you may find yourself in:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>You win three units. This occurs when all three of your bids are among the 8 highest bids.<br />Your profits for unit one are: &nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> - market price<br />Your profits for unit two are: &nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> - market price<br />Your profits for unit two are:  v<sub>3</sub> - market price<br />Total Profits are: &nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>3 </sub>&minus; 3 &times; market price</li>
    <li>You win two units. This occurs when two of your bids are among the 8 highest bids. Note in this case, your third bid is necessarily the only losing bid:
        Therefore this bid of yours sets the market price that you pay for the two units you won.<br />Your profits for unit one are:&nbsp;v<sub>1</sub> - market price<br />Your profits for unit two are: &nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> - market price<br />Total Profits are: = v<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp;v<sub>2</sub> &minus; 2 &times; market price</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any unit earned at a price <strong>below</strong> its value results in a <strong>positive profit</strong>; any unit earned at a price <strong>above</strong> its value results in a <strong>negative profit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
