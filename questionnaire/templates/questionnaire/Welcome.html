    <p>
        Thank you for participating in this experimental session! This is an experiment in the economics
        of market decision making. The instructions are simple, and if you follow them carefully and make
        good decisions, you may earn a considerable amount of money, which will be paid privately to you
        in cash at the end of the experiment. All money during this experiment is real money. Please do
        not talk with other participants and remain quiet during the entire experiment. Please turn off
        your cell phone and donâ€™t switch it on until the end of the experiment. If you have any questions,
        raise your hand and we will come to you.
