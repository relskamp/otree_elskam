<li>We will create a market in which you will act as bidder in a sequence of 25 seperate auctions. Each auction will have three identical units up for sale, which you and one other bidder are competing to purchase. You and your competitor can both earn money from purchasing up to two of these three identical units.</li>
<li>Each bidder will be assigned valuations for the two identical units for which they can earn money. These valuations represent the value of the good to you if you obtain it, i.e., what we will pay you for any items purchased. The values of each of the two units will be different from each other. If purchased, the first unit will provide you with a valuation denoted by: v<sub>1</sub>. If both units are purchased, your  total valuation  is  v<sub>1</sub>+v<sub>2</sub>. You can think of v<sub>2</sub> as the incremental value you get for purchasing a second unit above your initial value for the first unit purchased. Your valuations are known only to you and are completely independent of the valuations assigned to your competitors.    In other words, you don't know your competitor's valuations and they don't know your valuations.  Your valuations will be drawn anew before each auction.</li>
<li>The incremental value for the second unit (v<sub>2</sub>) will be randomly drawn from an interval where the lowest possible value is $0 and the highest possible value is $100.00.  Any value within this interval has an equally likely chance of being drawn and being assigned as your valuation. Values for the first unit (v<sub>1</sub>) will be drawn from an interval between v<sub>2</sub> and $100.00. Any value within this interval has an equally likely chance of being drawn and being assigned as your valuation.  This process to determine individual valations is the same for all bidders.</li>
