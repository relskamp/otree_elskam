<li>We will create a market in which you will act as bidder in a sequence of 25 seperate auctions. Each auction will have eight identical units up for sale, which you and two other bidders are competing to purchase. You and your competitors can both earn money from purchasing up to three of these eight identical units.</li>
<li>Each bidder will be assigned valuations for the three identical units  for which they can earn money. These valuations represent the value of the good to you if you obtain it, i.e., what we will pay you for any items purchased. The values of each of the three units will be different from each other. If purchased, the first unit will provide you with a valuation denoted by: v<sub>1</sub>.
     If two units are purchased, your total valuation is v<sub>1</sub>+v<sub>2</sub>. And finally, if you purchase three units, your total valuation is v<sub>1</sub>+v<sub>2</sub>+v<sub>3</sub>.
   You can think of v<sub>2</sub> as the incremental value you get for purchasing a second unit above your initial value for the first unit won and v<sub>3</sub> as the incremental value you get for purchasing a third unit. Your valuations are known only to you and are completely independent of the valuations assigned to your competitors.   In other words, you don't know your competitors' valuations and they don't know your valuations. Your valuations will be drawn anew before each auction.</li>
<li>The incremental value for the third unit (v<sub>3</sub>) will be randomly drawn from an interval where the lowest possible value is $0 and the highest possible value is $100.00. This is the same for all bidders. Any value within this interval has an equally likely chance of being drawn and being assigned as your valuation. Values for the second unit (v<sub>2</sub>) will be drawn from an interval between v<sub>3</sub> and  $100.00. Finally, values for the first unit (v<sub>1</sub>) will be drawn from an interval between v<sub>2</sub> and $100.00. Any value within each of these intervals has an equally likely chance of being drawn and being assigned as your valuation.</li>
