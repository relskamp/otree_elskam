     <p>Underlying these two illustrative examples is the fact that purchasing two
    units instead of one unit will almost surely increase the market price and thus directly reduce
    the profits you can earn on the first unit. The net result is that in some cases it will be profitable
    to increase your bid on the second unit (i.e., Example 1) and in some cases it will not be profitable to
    increase your bid on the second unit (i.e., Example 2).

      <p> You will not know which environment you are playing within because your competitors' bidding strategies and valuations are kept private and are unknown to you at the time of bidding.</p>
